Before making changes, please discuss your planned contributions via issue, email, or other channels with the repository owners.
This helps us provide guidance and feedback early in the process.

Follow our [Code of Conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct) in all project interactions.

## 🤝 Pull Request Process

1. **Fork repository** - Create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2. **Create feature branch** - Make a new branch from the main branch, use descriptive names.
3. **Make your changes** - Develop your planned feature or fix. Ensure code follows project standards.
4. **Run tests and linting** - Execute all test suites and linting to verify changes don't break existing features.
5. **Push changes to fork** - Upload your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
6. **Open pull request** - Create PR from your fork's branch to the main repository. Include clear title and description.
7. **Pass checks & resolve conflicts** - Ensure all automated checks pass and no conflicts exist with the main branch.
8. **Address review feedback** - Respond to reviewer comments with improvements or constructive discussion.
9. **Get merged** - Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main codebase.

For detailed guidance, see [GitHub's Pull Request documentation][pull-requests-docs].

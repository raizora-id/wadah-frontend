## What is Kibo UI?

Kibo UI components use the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) CSS variables and are designed to work neatly with the existing primitives.

Much like the core shadcn/ui primitives, the Kibo UI components are effectively a collection of building blocks that can be used to create more complex components. They encompass a wide range of use-cases and are designed to reduce boilerplate code without sacrificing flexibility and responsive design.

While shadcn/ui focuses on wrapping primitives from Radix UI, Kibo UI is designed to be a more comprehensive library of components that can be used to build more complex applications. The components wrap more complex logic from various headless libraries to provide a more seamless experience.

## Source code

Kibo UI is open source and available on GitHub:
